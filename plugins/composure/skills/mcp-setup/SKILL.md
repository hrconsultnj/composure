description: Discover and configure MCP servers for your project.
argument-hint: "[search-query] [--list] [--stack <override>]"

Discover and install MCP servers that enhance Claude Code for your project. Reads your detected stack to recommend relevant servers, then handles the full setup — package installation, config writing, env var prompts, and verification.

## Progress Tracking

This skill uses TaskCreate for progress tracking. Before starting work:
1. Create one task per major step using TaskCreate
2. Set each task to `in_progress` when starting it (TaskUpdate)
3. Mark `completed` when done
4. Write deliverables to files, not inline — inline text is for communication only

## Content Loading

Load each step through the fetch command (handles caching, decryption, and auth):

```bash
<home>/.composure/bin/composure-fetch.mjs skill composure mcp-setup {step-filename}
```

Replace `<home>` with the user's **resolved absolute home directory** (e.g., `/Users/username` on macOS, `/home/username` on Linux). Do NOT use `$HOME`, `~`, or quotes — Claude Code permissions require the literal path.

**Do NOT read cache files directly** — they are encrypted at rest. Always use the fetch command above.
